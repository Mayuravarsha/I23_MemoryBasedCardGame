In a memory game, a matrix consisting of many smaller boxes will be available, the user’s task will  be to win the game by matching patterns on particular boxes. When the user clicks one box, it  should show its pattern – if the next box clicked on has a similar pattern, both boxes should  remain flipped, and the score should be added. If the second box flipped does not have a similar  pattern, both boxes should stop showing their pattern. There is a lot of scope in doing this, and a lot of possible improvements. For instance, there can  be a way of storing the number of moves required as well as a leader board system for hosting  folks that have the best memory possible. If an “easy mode” is desirable, then a way to store  moves and move back and forth between each move can be added.
